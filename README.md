# 2024Fall-Automated-Warehouse-Inventory-Analysis

The Advanced Processing Research Network (APRN) at Georgia Southern University has sponsored research in
warehouse operations and port logistics. In future semesters, several projects will be started that require computer
vision analysis of warehouse functions, including storage and movement of inventory, stacking of pallets, and movement
of personnel and machinery. The data generated will be integrated with a warehouse management system (WMS).
The goal of this project is to prove the concept of integrating computer vision analysis with a WMS. A simple WMS
database will be designed and created to track clients, inventory, boxes, and pallets. Computer Vision techniques will be
used to identify boxes and pallets from barcodes and assess pallet quality, including box size and box stacking
configuration.
